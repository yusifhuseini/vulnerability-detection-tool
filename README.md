# Integrated Vulnerability Detection Tool

This tool is designed to streamline the process of identifying vulnerabilities in network systems and web applications. It combines three essential scanning modules:

*   **Port Scanning:** Identifies open ports and services on a target system.
*   **Weak Password Blasting:** Attempts to discover weak passwords for services like SSH, FTP, and Telnet.
*   **Directory Scanning:** Scans web server directories for hidden files and potential vulnerabilities.

## Features

*   **Integrated Approach:** Consolidates multiple scanning functionalities into a single, unified platform.
*   **User-Friendly Interface:** Offers both a command-line interface (CLI) and a graphical user interface (GUI) for ease of use.
*   **Modular Design:** Allows for easy extension and customization with additional scanning modules in the future.
*   **Customizable:** Supports custom wordlists for directory scanning and password lists for brute-force attacks.
*   **Real-Time Results:** Provides real-time feedback on the progress and findings of scans.
*   **Comprehensive Reporting:** Generates detailed reports of scan results for further analysis.
*   **Secure and Ethical:** Adheres to secure coding practices and emphasizes ethical use.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   Python 3.6 or later
*   Nmap (Network Mapper)
*   Install dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`. `pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Installation

1.  Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/yusifhuseini/vulnerability-detection-tool.git`
2.  Navigate to the project directory: `cd vulnerability-detection-tool`
3.  Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Usage

**Command-Line Interface (CLI):**

```bash
# Port Scanning
python detection_tool.py <target_ip> --scan-type port-scan

# Weak Password Blasting
python detection_tool.py <target_ip> --scan-type weak-password --username <username> --password-file <password_list.txt>

# Directory Scanning
python detection_tool.py <target_url> --scan-type directory-scan --wordlist <wordlist.txt>
```
**NOTE:** When using the CLI, be sure to include the arguments and parameters as needed for the scan, such as scan type, wordlist, and password file.
**Graphical User Interface (GUI):**

```bash
python detection_tool_gui.py
```

This will launch the GUI, where you can input the target and configure the scan options.

## Testing

Unit tests are available in the `unittest.py` file. To run them, execute:

```bash
python unittest.py
```

## Limitations

*   **False Positives/Negatives:** May occur due to the nature of vulnerability scanning.
*   **Evolving Threats:** Requires regular updates to stay effective against new vulnerabilities.
*   **Resource Constraints:** Large-scale scans can be resource-intensive.

## Future Enhancements

*   Integration of additional scanning modules (web app, network infrastructure, cloud, API).
*   Cloud-based deployment for scalability and collaboration.
*   Machine learning integration for improved accuracy and anomaly detection.
